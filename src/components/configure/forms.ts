/**
 * Every form in the template, in one list, because one page edits all of them.
 *
 * The template used to carry a `/configure` page per form and a JSON panel inside
 * each embedded demo — four editors for the same job. There is one now, and it is
 * a URL worth sharing: the definition on the left, the form it produces on the
 * right, for any form in the template.
 *
 * `user` is what separates the two halves of the list. The three template forms
 * are plain: one definition, one form. The three embedded ones are rendered *for
 * somebody* — their JSON reads `{user.something}` — so the preview needs an
 * account to render for, and it uses the first of the demo's preset users. The
 * users themselves are edited in the demo, in the toolbar's popup.
