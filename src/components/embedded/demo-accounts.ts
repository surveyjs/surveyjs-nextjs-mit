/**
 * The signed-in user each demo renders its form for — and the form used to edit
 * them, which is itself a SurveyJS survey.
 *
 * This is the second half of the pitch. The first half is that a SurveyJS form
 * can be dropped into somebody else's page and look native; this half is that the
 * same JSON definition arrives *already configured for whoever is looking at it* —
 * their name, their plan, their chart — and that the arrangement of the form
 * changes with them, not just the values in it.
 *
 * Mechanically it is one step: the account object is published to survey-core as
 * a single variable named `user` (`model.setVariable("user", account)`), and the
 * survey JSON reaches into it by path:
 *
 *  - `"title": "Hi {user.firstName}, …"` pipes the value into text;
 *  - `"defaultValueExpression": "{user.email}"` pre-answers a question;
 *  - `"visibleIf": "{user.isNewPatient} = true"` adds or removes whole pages;
 *  - `"visibleIf": "{user.conditions} contains 'asthma'"` on a *choice* builds a
 *    list out of the account.
 *
 * One variable rather than one per key, because a path can never be mistaken for
 * a question: the clinic form has questions called `firstName` and `email` too.
 *
 * Nothing here is SurveyJS-specific data: it is the shape an app already has
 * after `getSession()` or a CRM lookup. What is deliberate is where it comes from
 * in the demo — `json` below is a **survey**, so the toolbar's "Edit the user"
 * popup is the library editing the library's own input, with no bespoke form code
 * anywhere. Answers in, context object out; `toAccount` is the only translation,
 * and it exists to fill the display labels a dropdown's `value` cannot carry.
