/**
 * Embedded demo: a US clinic page whose appointment form prices the visit.
 *
 * Healthcare is where SurveyJS actually gets bought, and this is the page it gets
 * bought for — so the site around the form is built to the conventions a US
 * patient reads without noticing: the utility bar, the provider directory with
 * credentials, in-network plans, posted self-pay prices, the statutory notices.
 *
 * Two mechanics run at once here. The page is downstream of the form: every
 * answer flows out through `onDataChange`, `visitSummaryFor` derives the copay,
 * the referral warning and the what-to-bring list, and the page re-renders around
 * it — including the provider card and the office card the request names.
 *
 * And the form is downstream of the patient. A portal knows who you are, so the
 * office, the clinician, the plan and the identity fields all arrive filled, the
 * insurance-card fields are absent while a card is on file, and the questions
 * about existing conditions and refills are built from that patient's own chart.
 * Turn on "First visit to Ridgeline?" in the user popup and watch it invert: the
 * chart empties, Maria's four confirmations become the long form, and a page
 * appears that established patients never see.
