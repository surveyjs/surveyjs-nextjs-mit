 * The signed-in user, editable — in a SurveyJS form.

 * The demo's claim is that a survey arrives configured for whoever is looking at
 * it. This popup is where the reviewer plays the host application: change the
 * plan, the tenure, the chart, and the form on the page behind re-renders.
 *
 * Two deliberate choices:
 *
 *  - **the editor is a survey.** No bespoke form code exists for it — the JSON is
 *    in `demo-accounts.ts` and it goes through the same `EmbeddedSurvey` and the
 *    same shadcn adapter as the demo itself. It even uses the features it is
 *    demonstrating: the clinic's chart panel is `visibleIf`-gated on the "first
 *    visit" switch.
 *  - **the popup is not modal.** Radix keeps the page behind live and clickable,
 *    so the survey re-rendering as you type is visible rather than something you
 *    have to close a dialog to discover — and nothing outside it dismisses it.
 *
 * Underneath, the object actually handed to survey-core — answers in, context
 * out. It is read-only on purpose: the form above is the way to change it.
