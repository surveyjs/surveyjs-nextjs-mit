/**
 * Embedded demo: the clinician's side of the clinic — an encounter note.
 *
 * The other demos put a form inside a marketing page and let the page react to
 * it, which is the right story for a public form. This one is the opposite
 * argument, for the buyer who says *our real forms are nothing like that*: an
 * internal workspace whose entire screen is one survey, eight pages long, with
 * its own table of contents, its own review step, its own arithmetic and its own
 * completion page.
 *
 * So there is deliberately almost nothing here. A header bar with the product
 * mark, the chart that is open and a colour-scheme switch — and below it the
 * survey, full width. The pages, the table of contents, the problem list, the
 * medication totals, the risk score, the signature and the "note filed" screen
 * are all in `encounter-note.ts`; not one of them is React in this file. That is the claim,
 * and the emptiness of this component is the evidence for it.
 *
 * The note is still rendered *for* somebody: the same three patients as the
 * public clinic demo, so the toolbar opens any of their charts and the note
 * changes shape around them — Priya has never been seen here, so she has a page
 * the others do not.
