/**
 * A survey definition, rendered. This is the whole integration:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const model = createSurveyModel(schema, { data, mode });
 * return <Survey model={model} />;
 * ```
 *
 * Two lines, both below, and there is no third one hiding anywhere: no wrapper
 * component per form, no field registry, no adapter between the JSON and the
 * inputs. The four CSS imports above are the theme, and the survey then takes
 * its colours, radius and light/dark from the same shadcn tokens as the rest of
 * the app.
 *
 * Everything else in this file is convenience *this template* wanted, and each
 * piece is one hook you can delete without touching the rest:
 *
 *  - {@link useSavedDefinition} — swap in the definition a visitor edited on
 *    `/configure`, on the client only, so the server keeps sending the canonical
 *    form;
 *  - {@link usePrefillAction} — the "Prefill demo data" button in the survey's
 *    own navigation bar, for filling a long form in front of an audience;
 *  - {@link useSubmission} — what happens on completion: hand the answers to the
 *    caller, or POST them through the storage seam.
 *
 * Server rendering needs nothing special: this component is a client component
 * because survey-react-ui uses browser APIs, but Next.js still prerenders it, so
 * the form is in the HTML the server sends. See `/claims` — view source.
