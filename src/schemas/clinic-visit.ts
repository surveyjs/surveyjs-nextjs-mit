/**
 * "Request an appointment" — the form on Ridgeline Family Health's home page.
 *
 * This is the survey that belongs on a clinic site, and it is the one SurveyJS
 * is bought for: masked phone numbers, a date of birth, conditional insurance
 * panels, required consents, and a review step before anything is submitted.
 * Nothing exotic — the value is that it is the real shape of a real form, and it
 * needs no bespoke CSS to sit on a public-facing page.
 *
 * Every choice is generated from `clinic-info.ts`, so the form can never offer a
 * clinician the directory below it does not list, or a plan the coverage section
 * does not accept.
 *
 * And it is the strongest of the three demos for **personalisation**, because a
 * patient portal knows more about you than any other login you have. Everything
 * below reads the chart the host app passed in (`{user.…}`, see
 * `demo-accounts.ts`):
 *
 *  - the office, the clinician, the plan, the name, the date of birth and the
 *    phone number all arrive answered;
 *  - the identity fields are locked until the patient says something has changed,
 *    so an established patient confirms four things instead of typing nine;
 *  - the insurance-card fields are not there at all while a card is on file;
 *  - a whole extra page exists for a first-time patient and for nobody else;
 *  - "is this about something we already treat?" offers *this* patient's
 *    conditions, and the refill question *this* patient's medications — both
 *    assembled by survey-core from the chart, choice by choice.
 *
 * Swap the user in the toolbar and the same JSON is a different form.
