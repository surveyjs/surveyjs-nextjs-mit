/**
 * Plan finder — the form the embedded demo puts in its host site's hero.
 *
 * A survey that earns its place on a marketing page: it works out which of the
 * host's four plans and three add-on modules fit, prices the result, and collects
 * what the visitor wishes the product did.
 *
 * The pricing it reasons about is the same one the mock site's Pricing and Suite
 * sections advertise (`CadenceSite.tsx`), and the tiers are arranged so the
 * recommendation is never worse value than the alternative: two or more modules
 * cost more on Team ($12 + $4/$6/$5 each) than Business does flat ($19), so
 * `recommendedPlan` moves to Business at exactly that point.
 *
 * Demonstrates the parts of SurveyJS a product form actually needs, rather than
 * a questionnaire: `calculatedValues` deriving the plan, the module set and the
 * price from the answers, an `expression` question showing that price live,
 * `visibleIf` branching down to individual summary lines, a priority matrix, a
 * `ranking` question, and the result piped into the completion page.
