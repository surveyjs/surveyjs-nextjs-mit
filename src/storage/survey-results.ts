/**
 * One of the two seams between this template and your storage: the answers
 * people submit. Its sibling, `survey-json.ts`, covers the survey definitions.
 *
 * Nothing else in the app reads or writes a survey result — replace the four
 * bodies below with calls to your API and the rest of the template is untouched:
 *
 *   export async function listResults(): Promise<ClaimRecord[]> {
 *     const res = await fetch("/api/claims", { cache: "no-store" });
 *     if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`GET /api/claims: ${res.status}`);
 *     return res.json();
 *   }
 *
 * The signatures are async already, so swapping the implementation does not
 * change a single call site.
 *
 * Where each one runs: `listResults` is called by the `/records` server
 * component, so the table and the form are in the HTML the server sends; the
 * three mutations are called from the client, the way they would hit your API.
 * Point them all at the same database and that split is what a real app does.
 *
 * Nothing here persists, on purpose — a template should not look like it stores
 * someone's data when it does not. The seed array below is the whole store, so
 * an edit lives in the page's React state and is gone as soon as you navigate
 * away or reload.
